# Fluence.Wpf agent handbook

This file sets repository-wide rules and routes work to the smallest relevant guidance. Read it before editing, then read the nearest AGENTS.md for each affected path. When a change spans directories, follow every applicable file.

## Repository contract

- Fluence.Wpf is a WPF library that follows the Windows 11 Fluent and WinUI 3 visual language. The library targets .NET Framework 4.7.2, .NET 8 for Windows, and .NET 10 for Windows. Full tests target .NET Framework 4.7.2 and .NET 10; a separate smoke project covers .NET 8.
- Keep the library portable across downstream consumers. Consumer-specific paths and instructions belong in the consumer repository.
- Preserve existing user changes and keep edits within the requested scope. Add package dependencies only after the user approves them. Create commits only when the user has authorized a commit.
- Use Directory.Build.props, Directory.Packages.props, .editorconfig, project files, and scripts as the source of truth for build settings, analyzers, package versions, and commands. Do not duplicate their full configuration in guidance.
- New C# files need the existing BSD 3-Clause header. Public API changes need XML documentation. Follow the configured nullable and analyzer policies.
- The root CONTRIBUTING.md is the canonical source for the build and validation command set. Run focused checks for the change; use the full affected build and test matrix for release preparation.
- For visual decisions, prefer in-tree precedent, then the domain authority named in Fluence.Wpf/AGENTS.md, then Microsoft guidance. Do not invent undocumented WinUI behavior.

## Documentation ownership

This repository owns generated C# API pages in docs/api/ and PowerShell reference pages in docs/powershell/reference/, plus authored docs/controls.md, docs/theming.md, and docs/winui-parity.md. The standalone Fluence.Wpf.Website repository owns Docusaurus authoring, site navigation and styling, browser review, publishing, and runnable walkthroughs. Keep operational release material out of this repository's public documentation.
