function Set-FluenceWindowContent
{
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Builds the window for a specification and populates its content for the resolved mode.
    .DESCRIPTION
        For ContentBlock mode it builds a host window and invokes the user content block against it.
        For XamlString and XamlFile modes it parses or loads the XAML: a Window root is used directly
        (chrome and owner applied over it); any other root is hosted inside a new FluenceWindow. The
        optional Initialize block then runs against the window. The user block is resolved through
        Resolve-FluenceUserBlock so it runs live on a shared runspace or is recreated from text on the
        module-owned UI runspace. Any error the user block throws is captured on the shared state.
    .PARAMETER Spec
        The normalized window specification hashtable from Show-FluenceWindow.
    .PARAMETER State
        A shared @{ Error = $null } hashtable that carries any user-block error back to the caller.
    .OUTPUTS
        System.Windows.Window
    .NOTES
        Must run on a UI (STA) thread; call it through Show-FluenceWindowCore.
